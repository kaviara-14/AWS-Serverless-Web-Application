### 3. Creating Lambda Functions
We'll write Lambda functions in Python to handle the API Gateway requests. For example, we'll create functions to retrieve data from DynamoDB and insert new data into it.

### 5. Implementing Secure Connections with CloudFront 
To ensure secure access to our web application, we'll deploy CloudFront as a content delivery network (CDN). We'll configure CloudFront to serve our S3 content securely over HTTPS, providing encryption in transit and improving the performance of our application.
